🚗 Car Rental System
📌 Project Overview

The Car Rental System is a Java-based console application developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) concepts.
The project simulates a real-world car rental process where users can rent cars, return them, and calculate rental charges.

This project helped me understand core Java, modular programming, and enterprise-style application structure.

🎯 Objectives

To apply OOPS concepts in a real-world scenario

To build a modular and maintainable Java application

To understand business logic used in rental systems

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Java

Concepts: OOPS (Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism)

Tools: VS Code

⚙️ Features / Functional Modules

Car Registration Module – Add and manage car details

Car Availability Module – Check available cars for rent

Booking Module – Rent a car to customers

Return Module – Return rented cars and update status

Billing Module – Calculate rental charges based on days

🧩 OOPS Concepts Implemented

Classes & Objects – For cars, customers, and rentals

Encapsulation – Data hiding using private variables and methods

Inheritance – Code reusability across related classes

Polymorphism – Method overriding for flexible behavior
